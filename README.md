## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the Python libraries and dependencies required to run the project.
  
- `.gitignore`: This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.

- `README.md`: This file is an outcome of displaying the projects documentation.

- `app.py`: This is the Flask application file responsible for hosting the web application.

- `notebooks`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, visualization and model training . The `data` folder within this directory contains the dataset used for this project.

- `setup.py`: This is the setup file for the project, which may include additional configuration settings.

- `src`: This directory contains the source code for the project, organized into several subdirectories and files:
    - `logs`: This directory contains log files generated by the project.
    - `components`: This directory contains Python modules for various project components, including:
        - `data_ingestion.py`: Handles the process of loading and preparing the dataset.
        - `data_transformation.py`: Performs data preprocessing and feature engineering.
        - `model_trainer.py`: Contains code for training and evaluating machine learning models.
    - `pipelines`: This directory contains data processing or machine learning pipelines used in the project, including:
        - `training_pipeline.py`: Defines the training pipeline for model development.
        - `prediction_pipeline.py`: Defines the pipeline for making predictions using the trained model.
    - `exception.py`: Thos file provide a way to create and raise user-defined errors with specific context and messaging, enhancing error handling and code clarity.
    - `logger.py`: This file helps us to record and manage application events and information, facilitating debugging and monitoring.
    - `utils.py`: Contains utility functions used throughout the project.
